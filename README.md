# Movie Success Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes IMDb-style movie data to understand what factors contribute to a movie’s success.  
Using **Excel** for data cleaning and **Power BI** for dashboard creation, the project visualizes trends in genres, ratings, budgets, revenues, top directors and top actors.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and formatting  
- **Microsoft Power BI** – Interactive dashboard development and data visualization  

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes key movie-related attributes such as:  
- Movie Title  
- Genre  
- IMDb Rating  
- Director  
- Top Actors  
- Budget  
- Gross Revenue  
- Year of Release  
- Content Rating  

This data helps identify performance patterns and key contributors to successful movies.

## Key Insights
1. **Drama and Action** are the most frequently produced genres.  
2. **IMDb ratings stay stable around 6.5–7**, with mild peaks after 2010.  
3. **Top-rated films score above 8.5**, making them stand out critically.  
4. **PG-13** is the most common content rating across the dataset.  
5. **Higher budgets often lead to higher gross**, though exceptions exist with profitable low-budget films.
